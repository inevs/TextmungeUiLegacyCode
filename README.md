# TextmungeUiLegacyCode

This is an example to refactor legacy code. Try to add new functionality: 

  * I want to munge more than one word.
  * I want to ignore punctuation marks.

# Working with the code

Run all tests with `./gradlew` (*nix) or `gradlew.bat` (Windows)

Create project files with `./gradlew eclipse` or `./gradlew idea`
